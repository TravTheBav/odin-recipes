        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Doesn't that look delicious? Whether on a hot summer day or in the middle
            of winter, a good matzo ball soup gets the job done.  To the uninitiated,
            matzo ball soup is basically a chicken noodle soup with a matzo ball in it.
            Matzo balls are kind of like a bready dumpling that takes on the flavor of
            the broth. By themselves they aren't very good, but combined with the soup
            they are excellent! But enough talk, let's dive into the recipe.
